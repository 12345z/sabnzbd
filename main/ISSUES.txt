List of known issues.

Sometimes some delay before first download starts.

The dirscan-dir (aka blackhole) will accept only NZB and ZIP-files containing NZB-s.
Do not put arbitrary other ZIP files in this directory. They will be deleted.

Memory usage can sometimes have high peaks. This makes using SABnzbd on very low
memory systems (eg a SAN device) a challenge.

SABnzbd is not compatible with the ZoneAlarm firewall.
Comodo and the Windows firewall work fine.

The Plush interface is a heavy load on the browser when the queue is very large.

The Plush and SMPL user interfaces may have some issues when used on IE6 or IE7.
This is mainly due to the fact that Microsoft keeps ignoring HTML standards.
Also IE6 en IE7 are very much incompatible.
FireFox 2 is the best browser to use for interfaces other than Default.

Sometimes logging stops. This is a notorious bug in Python logging. SABnzbd will
function as normal. If you run from sources or use the --console option with the
Win32-binary, you will see that logging continues in the console window, but
nothing will be written to the log-files.
