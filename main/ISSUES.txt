*******************************************

- When par2 or unrar hang up, never just stop SABnzbd.
  Instead use your operating system's task manager to stop the par2 or unrar program.
  Forcing SABnzbd to quit may damage your queues.
  Windows-only:
  If you keep having trouble with par2 multicore you can disable it
  in Config->Switches.
  This will force the use of the old and tried, but slower par2-classic program.

- Windows cannot handle pathnames longer than 254 characters.
  Currently, SABnzbd doesn't handle this problem gracefully.
  We have added the INI-only option "folder_length_max" in which you can set
  a maximum folder name size.
  For Windows the default is 128 and for others 256.
  A quite safe value for Windows would be 64.
  SABnzbd will take care of overlapping names.

- Some Usenet servers have intermittent login (or other) problems.
  For these the server blocking method is not very favourable.
  There is an INI-only option that will limit blocks to 1 minute.
      no_penalties = 1

- On OSX you will have problems running Python user scripts.
  This is caused by wrong behaviour of the Python-to-app converter we use.
  Currently we cannot fix this. As a work-around you need to add
  the -E parameter to the first line of your Python script.
  Example:
        #!/bin/python -E

- On OSX you may encounter downloaded files with foreign characters.
  The par2 repair may fail when the files were created on a Windows system.
  The problem is caused by the PAR2 utility and we cannot fix this now.
  This does not apply to files inside RAR files.

- On Linux when you download files they may have the wrong character encoding.
  You will see this only when downloaded files contain accented characters.
  You need to fix it yourself by running the convmv utility (availaible for most Linux platforms).

- The "Watched Folder" sometimes fails to delete the NZB files it has
  processed. This happens when other software still accesses these files.
  Some third-party utilities supporting SABnzbd are known to do this.
  We cannot solve this problem, because the Operating System (read Windows)
  prevents the removal.

- Jobs deleted from the queue will leave downloaded files behind
  in the "incomplete" folder.
  You will have to remove these files manually.

- Memory usage can sometimes have high peaks. This makes using SABnzbd on very low
  memory systems (eg a SAN device) a challenge.

- SABnzbd is not compatible with some software firewall versions.
  The Mircosoft Windows Firewall works fine, but remember to tell this
  firewall that SABnzbd is allowed to talk to other computers.

- When SABnzbd cannot send nofication emails, check your virus scanner,
  firewall or securiry suite. It may be blocking outgoing email.

- When you are using external drives or network shares on OSX or Linux
  make sure that the drives are mounted.
  The operating system wil simply redirect your files to alternative locations.
  You may have trouble finding the files when mounting the drive later.

- Sometimes logging stops. This is a notorious bug in Python logging. SABnzbd will
  function as normal. If you run from sources or use the --console option with the
  Win32-binary, you will see that logging continues in the console window, but
  nothing will be written to the log-files.
