List of known issues.

Memory usage can sometimes have high peaks. This makes using SABnzbd on very low
memory systems (eg a SAN device) a challenge.

SABnzbd is not compatible with some ZoneAlarm firewall versions.
Comodo and the Windows firewall work fine.

The Plush and SMPL user interfaces may have issues when used with IE6 or IE7.
This is mainly due to the fact that Microsoft keeps ignoring HTML standards.
FireFox 2 is the best browser to use for interfaces other than Default.

Plush's side-by-side display of queue and history does not work in FireFox 2.
The Plush interface is a heavy load on the browser when the queue is very large.

Sometimes logging stops. This is a notorious bug in Python logging. SABnzbd will
function as normal. If you run from sources or use the --console option with the
Win32-binary, you will see that logging continues in the console window, but
nothing will be written to the log-files.
