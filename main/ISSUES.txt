List of known issues.

*** Known problems ***

- On Linux when you download files they may have the wrong character encoding.
  You will see this only when downloaded files contain accented characters.
  You need to fix it yourself by running the convmv utility (availaible for most Linux platforms)

- On OSX there is a problem with downloading and parring files with accented characters.

- The "Watched Folder" sometimes fails to delete the NZB files it has
  processed. This happens when other software still accesses these files.
  Some third-party utilities supporting SABnzbd are known to do this.
  We cannot solve this problem, because the Operating System (read Windows)
  prevents the removal.

- Jobs deleted from the queue will leave downloaded files behind
  in the "incomplete" folder.
  You will have to remove these files manually.

- Memory usage can sometimes have high peaks. This makes using SABnzbd on very low
  memory systems (eg a SAN device) a challenge.

- SABnzbd is not compatible with some ZoneAlarm firewall versions.
  Comodo and the Windows firewall work fine.

- Sometimes logging stops. This is a notorious bug in Python logging. SABnzbd will
  function as normal. If you run from sources or use the --console option with the
  Win32-binary, you will see that logging continues in the console window, but
  nothing will be written to the log-files.
