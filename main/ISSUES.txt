List of known issues.

*** Still under investigation ***

- When the Internet connection breaks down, SABnzbd will still show
  "downloading" and show a constant speed.
  This problem only occurs when at least one connection uses SSL.
  When the Internet connection is restored, downloadign will proceed
  after some minutes (depending on the time-outs you set).

- Shutdown-PC-on-empty-queue is reported to be unreliable.
  We have not been able to reproduce the problem. Also we do not know
  whether the problem is that end-of-queue is not detected or that
  the shutdown itself does not work.


*** Known problems ***

- When you have aggressive power managment on (like automatic standby)
  the PC will go into standby despite the fact that SABnzbd is still
  busy downloading. Blame Windows for this.
  In a later release we will try to add code to report to Windows that
  SABnzbd is active.

- Deleted jobs will leave downloaded files behind in the "incomplete" folder.
  You will have to remove these files manually.

- Memory usage can sometimes have high peaks. This makes using SABnzbd on very low
  memory systems (eg a SAN device) a challenge.
  On some NAS/SAN systems you may have to downgrade CherryPy to 2.2.1.
  Remove the "cherrypy" directory inside SABnzbd and install an older
  CherryPy as a Python module.


- SABnzbd is not compatible with some ZoneAlarm firewall versions.
  Comodo and the Windows firewall work fine.

- Sometimes logging stops. This is a notorious bug in Python logging. SABnzbd will
  function as normal. If you run from sources or use the --console option with the
  Win32-binary, you will see that logging continues in the console window, but
  nothing will be written to the log-files.
