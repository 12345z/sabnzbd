List of known issues.

*** Under investigation ***
- We are investigating reports of downloads hanging in the
  last bit of the actual download.
- On some systems, SABnzbd gradually uses more memory without
  ever reducing it.

So far we have too little information to reproduce these problems.
Please report such problems on the forum with as much information
as possibe (OS, amount of usenet servers etc.)


*** Known problems ***

- On OSX you may encounter downloaded files with foreign characters.
  The par2 repair may fail when the files were created on a Windows system.
  The problem is caused by the PAR2 utility and we cannot currently fix this.
  This does not apply to files inside RAR files.

- On Linux when you download files they may have the wrong character encoding.
  You will see this only when downloaded files contain accented characters.
  You need to fix it yourself by running the convmv utility (availaible for most Linux platforms).

- The "Watched Folder" sometimes fails to delete the NZB files it has
  processed. This happens when other software still accesses these files.
  Some third-party utilities supporting SABnzbd are known to do this.
  We cannot solve this problem, because the Operating System (read Windows)
  prevents the removal.

- Jobs deleted from the queue will leave downloaded files behind
  in the "incomplete" folder.
  You will have to remove these files manually.

- Memory usage can sometimes have high peaks. This makes using SABnzbd on very low
  memory systems (eg a SAN device) a challenge.

- SABnzbd is not compatible with some software firewall versions.
  The Mircosoft Windows firewall work fine.

- Sometimes logging stops. This is a notorious bug in Python logging. SABnzbd will
  function as normal. If you run from sources or use the --console option with the
  Win32-binary, you will see that logging continues in the console window, but
  nothing will be written to the log-files.

- Some people have reported problems with very large jobs (think 50G +)
  Especially on low memory systems.
