List of known issues.

*** Still under investigation ***

- Shutdown-PC-on-empty-queue is reported to fail sometimes.
  We have not been able to reproduce the problem. Also we do not know
  whether the problem is that end-of-queue is not detected or that
  the shutdown itself does not work.


*** Known problems ***

- The "Watched Folder" sometimes fails to delete the NZB files it has
  processed. This happens when other software still accesses these files.
  Some third-party utilities supporting SABnzbd are known to do this.
  We cannot solve this problem, because the Operating System (read Windows)
  prevents the removal.

- Jobs deleted from the queue will leave downloaded files behind
  in the "incomplete" folder.
  You will have to remove these files manually.

- Memory usage can sometimes have high peaks. This makes using SABnzbd on very low
  memory systems (eg a SAN device) a challenge.

- SABnzbd is not compatible with some ZoneAlarm firewall versions.
  Comodo and the Windows firewall work fine.

- Sometimes logging stops. This is a notorious bug in Python logging. SABnzbd will
  function as normal. If you run from sources or use the --console option with the
  Win32-binary, you will see that logging continues in the console window, but
  nothing will be written to the log-files.
