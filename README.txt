************************  SABnzbd 0.6.9RC1  ************************

What's new:
- Update Plush to solve minor browser incompatibilities
- On Windows the 64bit versions of par2 and unrar were never used
- Updated unrar to 4.01
- Using the "Download" button in newzbin.com RSS feeds produced malformed names.
- When removing job folders in the "temporary download folder", remove everything.
  This is needed because some operating systems add spurious files and folders.

- OSX has now a Leopard/SnowLeopard DMG and a Lion-only DMG
  You can see the difference in the DMG's background image
